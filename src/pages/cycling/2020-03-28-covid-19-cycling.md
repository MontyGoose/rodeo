## Sufferfest

I've first tried Sufferfest about 5 years ago, when the model was to download a video, which you could re-use.  The video had instructions within, which gave an indication of how much you should be suffering - sometimes also a cadence to match.

Sufferfest changed a number of years ago to a subscription model - probably realising that once they'd sold a video, repeat custom was marginal!  Lots more vidoes, lots more instructions and now linking to their system providing insights into workouts and their own 'special' FTP - 4D... yep - we all needed something else!

Used for 2 months.  Did about 2/3 sessions a week - lots of different levels, types.  They also do yoga and strength training - didn't try these (yet)

## Zwift

The gamiifcation system for indoor riding.  It's about points (or drops as Zwift call them).  Some fancy graphics, upgrade bikes, wheels and kit - level ups, bonuses and you have yourself the basis of all addictive games.  Except, for this one, you have to hurt yourself and ride indoors.

I've been doing this if 2 months now - 3/4 times a week.  Level 12 if you want to know.

I've done a training package, raced, riden the 'mountain' and done all the maps .... so what now ... er .. do it all again...
